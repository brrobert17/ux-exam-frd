# Ethical Transit App

A simple vanilla JavaScript application showcasing ethical design principles for a transit route planning app. This application is designed with accessibility, dark mode, and mobile responsiveness in mind.

2. **Data Minimization**: Only collects necessary information
3. **Transparency**: Clear information about how data is used
4. **No Dark Patterns**: Avoids manipulative design techniques
5. **Environmental Awareness**: Highlights eco-friendly route options
